## Acknowledgements

This package was originally inspired by the package [Authable](https://github.com/mustafaturan/authable), another Oauth2 Provider implementation. Thank you to that package's author, [Mustafa Turan](https://github.com/mustafaturan), for his work on Authable and discussions on Oauth2.
